Cobblemon is an online modifaction(mod) to popular game Minecraft, which seeks to impliment features from another popular video game series Pokemon. This includes the various creatures, charachters, catching, and battle mechanics; but where it differs from other mods is that every model in game is uniquely made in a fitting Minecraft aesthetic. The mod has been praised for being the most natural fusion of the two different game mechanics and aesthetics and its opensource codebase along with its openess with the community leaves tons of room for customization and addons. This has resulted in many people making additional mods specifically for Cobblemon, and people like to impliment the mechanics of all their favorite mods known as modpacks. 

I had used popular modpack Cobbleverse as a base and had added on a few other additional mods that had included more Pokemon, items, and additional models; there were even a few mods where I had to change the code itself in order to impliment some of my own features and changes. The mods I had changed was the Cobblemon Pastures, which allows for a breeding & inheritence mechanic for the pokemon, Cobblemon Collectors, which allowed for the passive farming of drops/loot from Pokemon, Cobble:Ride-On!, which allowed for the mounting and riding of pokemon like vehicles, and Cobblemon Re-sizer, which allowed for pokemon to spawn at random sizes and to be manually resized using in game commands. Using Visual Studio I had made some additions which allowed me to customize exactly what traits would inherited from parent pokemon, what loot would drop for each pokemon, the positioning of the player on most pokemon mounts, made many other pokemon rideable, and changed the ride speed of each pokemon to greater reflect the speed of the pokemon as portayed in other medias. 

This modpack was my first experience with modding for video game modding and even though the changes themselves weren't complicated or even all that original I had gotten my first real experience with game modding, assited by no one except whatever documentation existed online or was leftover from the orignal modders.
