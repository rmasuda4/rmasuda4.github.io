## Project: Gamer Connect

## Overview
The problem:
 Many UH students love gaming, but finding others who play the same games, enjoy similar playstyles, or are available during matching times can be difficult. As a result, students often miss out on forming teams, competing together, or simply socializing through shared gaming experiences.
 
The solution:
 Gamer Connect is a web application that helps UH students discover and connect with other gamers on campus based on their favorite games, skill levels, gaming goals (casual play, ranked competition, streaming, etc.), and availability. By creating detailed gamer profiles, students can find like-minded players to form teams, join communities, or just find new friends to play with.

## Approach
Users create a profile that lists:
- Favorite games
- Platforms (e.g., PC, Switch, PS5, Xbox, Mobile)
- Preferred genres (e.g., FPS, RPG, MOBA, Fighting)
- Skill levels
- Availability

Once profiles are created, users can:
- Browse or search for compatible players using filters like game title, goal, and availability
- Send connection requests or messages to other users
- Create or join “squads” centered around specific games or events

Admins can:
- Moderate profiles and messaging for appropriate content
- Add new supported games or categories
- Feature trending games or UH-based gaming events

## Mockup Pages
- Landing page: Overview of the site with login/register options and featured games.
- Profile page: User’s own gaming profile with preferred games, consoles, availability, external links to socials
+ User suggestion box for games they want to add to the website
- Browse players: Search and filter by game, platform, playstyle, or skill level.
- Squads page: View or create groups for upcoming events, tournaments, or cooperative sessions.
+ Forums or chat sections
- Admin page: Tools for moderation, adding games, and managing reported content.

## Use Case Ideas
- A new user signs up, logs in, and creates their gaming profile
- A user searches for other players who play Valorant or Smash Bros, filters by “Competitive,” and sends invites to form a team.
-  user joins a “UH Friday Night Smash” squad and RSVPs for a local meetup.
-  An admin logs in to remove inappropriate content and update the game list.

## Beyond The Basics
Once the core system is implemented, advanced features could include:
- Event scheduling: Create, join, or RSVP to gaming sessions (local or online).
- Matchmaking: Automatically suggest compatible teammates based on shared games and availability.
- Statistics and achievements: Track activity (games played, squads joined, tournaments attended).
- UH eSports integration: Coordinate with UH eSports Club for official events or tournaments.
- Discord or Twitch integration: Link social accounts or streams directly to profiles.

## Possible Expansion 
- AI Integration for edge cases that a hard search/filter option might miss
- Top games page that shows the top games that users have added to their preferences.
