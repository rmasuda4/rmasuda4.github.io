  Software has always fascinated me because of the creativity and seemingly unlimited potential that it offers in the digital world. I like the idea of taking an idea and bringing it to life through code, especially when it comes to video games. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how games work behind the scenes, from their mechanics to their designs. This passion has continued to feed my interest in learning how to build software that can make an impact, whether it’s creating entertainment through games or through practical online tools to assist in everyday life. Software engineering also appeals to me because it’s a field that is always evolving, so there’s always something new to learn and explore.



## Technical and Job Skills



  In the future, I hope to develop a strong understanding and get some practice with JavaScript, since I know that it is commonly used in web-based games. I also want to gain experience working with software engineering problems and gain new techniques to improve my logical thinking. Another area I’m interested in is learning about software design principles and how to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I am also very interested in the real-world skills this course may teach me, such as building professional personas, learning how to treat a work environment, and how to get into he mindset of a software engineer.  



  Beyond technical skills, I also want to gain experience working on collaborative projects. Being able to work as part of a team is an important skill in the software industry, especially for game development, where designers, artists, and programmers have to come together to create a final product. I hope to work on projects where I can practice communicating ideas clearly and managing tasks with others. These experiences will help me grow not just as a programmer, but as a teammate and problem solver.



## General Goals

 Overall, my goal is to gain many of the skills that come with software engineering so that I may apply them to game development. By continuing to learn and challenge myself, I believe I can create software that brings people joy and solves real-world problems. Through my education and future experiences, I hope to develop both the technical and teamwork skills I need to succeed in the ever-changing world of technology.
