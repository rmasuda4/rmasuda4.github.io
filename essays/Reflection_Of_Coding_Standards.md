## Coding Standards and My Experience With ESLint



 When I hear coding standards my first thought is dread and tedious little fixes, like a missing comma there or a curly brace in the wrong place. While those little things do build up over large coding projects, there is more to coding standards on a conceptual level. They set the tone for how clean, consistent, and readable code should be; this allows for an easier debugging process and can make anybody reading your code(mabye with the exception of AI) easier. I think coding standards is one of the simplest ways to improve code quality, even if I’m not sure they’re the single best technique out there.
Basic standards can be quite helpful when learning a new programming language as well. Even though every language has its quirks, certain habits like consistent formatting and clear naming carry over and make it easier to write code that others can understand. At the same time, I do think coding standards can go a little too far. Sometimes the rules feel tedious or overly strict, especially when you’re just trying to get your program to work.
Using ESLint with VS Code has been a good experience overall. At first, it was a bit annoying to fix every little thing it flagged, like missing commas or empty line spacing. Most of those are easy fixes, but the type declaration rules can get confusing and slow me down. Still, I’ve realized that ESLint really helps with code consistency, even for small projects. It also makes debugging and code reviews easier because everyone’s code follows the same rules.
